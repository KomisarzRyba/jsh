# JSH - JavaScript to Bash Transpiler

## Introduction

Welcome to the JSH project, a cutting-edge compiler initiative aimed at transpiling JavaScript-like syntax into Bash scripts. This project is currently in progress and promises to bring the flexibility and familiarity of JavaScript to the world of Bash scripting.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of JSH is to create a reliable and efficient transpiler that enables developers to write scripts in a JavaScript-like syntax, which are then seamlessly converted into Bash scripts. This approach is designed to leverage the ease and expressiveness of JavaScript while harnessing the power and ubiquity of Bash in Unix-based environments.

## Current Progress

As of now, the project is in its developmental stages. Key components are being actively developed and refined. The current focus is on building a robust lexer (as seen in lexer.rs), which is a crucial part of the compiler pipeline. Additionally, we have an example script (example.jsh) that demonstrates the proposed JavaScript-like syntax intended for use with this transpiler.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from enthusiastic developers and software engineers who are interested in advancing this project. Whether it's code contributions, suggestions, or feedback, all forms of collaboration are appreciated.

### Disclaimer

Please note that JSH is a project under active development. As such, features and functionalities are subject to change, and the current version might not be fully operational.

Stay tuned for updates as we make progress in making JSH a robust and user-friendly transpiler!
